# Snake
Game Snake written in C++(用C++写的贪吃蛇小游戏)

- 🔭This game is based on EasyX graphics library, written in C + + in Visual Studio 2019, there are three gamemodes. 

- 🤔At present, the basic functions of the game have been improved. Limited level, there are many problems, such as occasional or different devices may flash screen problems, there are other small problems, as well as key steering delay and so on.

- 🌱Code comments are very detailed, should be relatively easy to understand.

- Flash screen problem has been found where the problem is, cleardevice() function used once will flash a screen. The faster the speed of the rapid mode is, the more times the cleardevice() function is used and the more serious the flicker is. 

- 🔭这个游戏是基于easyX图形库，在Visual Studio 2019上用C++写的，目前有三种游戏模式。

- 🤔游戏目前基本功能已经完善。水平有限，还有许多问题，例如偶尔或者不同设备可能会出现闪屏的问题，还有其他的一些小问题，以及按键转向存在延迟等问题。

- 🔭代码注释很详细，应该是属于比较易懂的。

- 闪屏问题已经发现了问题所在，是cleardevice()函数使用一次就会闪烁一次屏幕。急速模式速度越快，cleardevice()函数使用次数越多，闪烁越严重。
